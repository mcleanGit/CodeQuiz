# Title: Coding Quiz Challenge

*Motivation.* As an executive leader for many years in higher-education and innovation in the performing arts and digital media, I am driven by the socio-economic, organizational, and technological impact of these transformative fields. Now that my institutional administrative role is completed, I am reengaged in many ongoing projects in interdisciplinary research and infrastructure development. In addition to their legacy value, some of those projects also explore new horizons, in part related to my role as co-founder of Digital Media at the Crossroads (DM@X) and other networking initiatives. I am motivated to expand my circle of influence and range of capability by working from the ground up, to explore the coding and implementation aspects of the digital present and future as an important complement to my executive experience in these areas. Although at this stage of my career I am more likely to be  on the employer side of the hiring table, I am interested in developing my coding skills and perspective on this side of the industry. The current CodeQuiz application is part of that process.

*Background info on  assigned task.* As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. For this challenge, you will build a timed code quiz that's made up of multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Elements of the app
```
Timed Quiz on elements of JS code
```
Intro Page describes the app
Start Quiz button initiates countdown clock and clears intro page
A series of multiple choice questions is provided
Answers are selected by clicking the answer buttons.
Alerts indicate if the answers are -correct!- or -incorrect!-
Incorrect answers result in a -10 second penalty on the countdown.
When all questions are answered or the time reaches 0, the quiz is over
The TimeLeft on the clock becomes the score
Subsequent development would save the result to localStorage
And call an external file that would hold high-score rankings

Note: an additional html file -index+.html is provided that shows -without complete css- the div elements of results and high score that follow the  JS-drive quiz pages. These are also set up to be created and appended as JS objects. --Some of this still incomple--
